    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 tsp of the oil in a nonstick Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook, turning occasionally, until browned, about 6 minutes; transfer to bowl.

        <li>Add the remaining 1 tsp of oil to the same Dutch oven, then add the kielbasa. Cook over medium-high heat until browned, about 4 minutes.

        <li>Add 2 of the garlic cloves, the leek, carrots, and apple to the kielbasa in the Dutch oven. Cook, stirring, 1-2 minutes. Return the chicken to the Dutch oven. Add the tomatoes, broth, wine, beans, sugar, allspice, and bay leaf; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, covered, until the chicken is cooked through and the vegetables are tender, about 25 minutes.

        <li>Combine the parsley, lemon zest, and remaining 1 chopped garlic clove in a small bowl; set aside. Discard bay leaf. Sprinkle the cassoulet with the parsley mixture just before serving. Yields generous 1 cup per serving.
