    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a 4- to 6-quart slow cooker, combine the tomatoes, onion, garlic, tomato paste, garam masala, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Place the chicken on top of the vegetables, cover, and cook until the chicken is tender, on low for 7 to 8 hours or on high for 3 to 4 hours (this will shorten total recipe time).
        
        <li>In a small bowl, toss the cucumber and cilantro with the lemon juice and 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate for up to 8 hours.
        
        <li>Twenty minutes before serving, cook the rice according to the package directions.
        
        <li>Just before serving, stir the cream into the chicken tikka masala. Serve over the rice with the cucumber relish.
