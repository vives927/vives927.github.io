    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>For the meatballs:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs ground pork or ground beef
        <li>2 tsp sesame oil

    <p>For the sauce:</p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400&deg; F.

        <li>In a large bowl, mix together meatball ingredients until well-combined. Shape into balls (I made mine about 1.5 inches, which yielded about 35 meatballs, but 1 inch is probably standard), and place on a greased baking sheet or in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until meatballs are golden on the outside and no longer pink on the inside.

        <li>While the meatballs are baking, whisk together all of the sauce ingredients until blended. Once meatballs have finished cooking, you can either dip each meatball individually (using a toothpick) in the sauce mixture. Or you can pour the sauce over the meatballs and gently stir them until covered.

        <li>Serve warm, and sprinkle with additional garnish if desired.
