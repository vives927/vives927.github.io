<div class="ingredients">
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>For the mushrooms:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>12 oz sliced mushrooms
        <li>1 Tbsp butter
        <li>1 Tbsp chopped fresh thyme
    </ul>
    <p>For the bread:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 unsliced loaf sourdough bread
        <li>12 ounces Provolone cheese, thinly sliced
        <li>1/2 cup butter, melted
        <li>1/2 cup finely diced green onion
        <li>2 teaspoons poppy seeds
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a medium skillet on medium. Add the butter. Once the butter is melted, add the mushrooms. Cook 4-5 minutes until they start to sweat. Add the thyme and continue to cook another 2-3 minutes. Set mushrooms aside and allow to cool.

        <li>Preheat oven to 350&deg; F. Cut the bread lengthwise and widthwise without cutting through the bottom crust. This can be a little tricky going the second way but the bread is very forgiving. Place loaf on a foil-lined baking sheet. Insert cheese slices between cuts. Pour the mushrooms between the cuts. Use your fingers to push the mushrooms down into the loaf.

        <li>Combine butter, onion, and poppy seeds. Drizzle over bread. Wrap foil around bread and bake for 15 minutes.

        <li>Unwrap the bread and bake 10 more minutes, or until cheese is melted.

    <p>It was really hard to stuff all of the ingredients into the loaf that I bought. I would recommend a bigger loaf next time!</p>
