    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup quinoa, uncooked
        <li>1 3/4 cup veggie broth, divided
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil, divided
        <li>1 small onion, chopped
        <li>8 oz cremini mushrooms, stemmed and sliced
        <li>4 oz shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and sliced
        <li>3 oz oyster mushrooms, stemmed and sliced
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced or pressed
        <li>1-2 tsp minced fresh chives
        <li>1/2 tsp fresh thyme leaves
        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste
        <li>7-8 oz gouda, shredded*
        <li>½ cup low-fat greek yogurt (optional)
    </ul>
    <p><i>*For best results, always use freshly shredded cheese.  Pre-shredded cheese comes coated in things such as flour, cornstarch to prevent clumping and results in an unpleasant, gritty texture when melted.</i></p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Thoroughly rinse and drain the quinoa. Add to a medium pan with 1 1/2 cups of the veggie broth and cook according to the package directions. Set aside.

        <li>Preheat the oven to 400&deg; F. Grease a 2-quart baking dish. In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over medium-high heat. Sauté the onion until it begins to soften, about 5 minutes. Stir in the sliced mushrooms and continue to cook, stirring occasionally until the mushrooms have softened and most of the juices released have evaporated. Stir in the garlic, chives and thyme. Add in the remaining 1/4 cup of veggie broth to deglaze the pan, scraping any browned bits that have stuck to the bottom. Continue to cook until the liquid is almost evaporated. Remove from the heat. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked quinoa, the mushroom mixture, about 2/3 of the shredded gouda, the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil and the greek yogurt. Stir well until evenly mixed.  Spread the mixture in the prepared baking dish in an even layer and sprinkle with the remaining cheese. Bake until heated through and the cheese is melted and bubbling, about 12-15 minutes. Serve warm.
